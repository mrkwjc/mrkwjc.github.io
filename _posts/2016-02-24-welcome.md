Recently, i felt the need to start sharing my thoughts related to numerical analysis in engineering, artificial intelligence, programming and such things. So here i am with this blog :smile:. 

In the posts i can:

* use advanced math (via MathJax), both inline, like $\sin{90^{\circ}} = 1$, and displayed:
    \begin{equation}
        \int{\frac{\log{x}}{\sum_{n=1}^{5}{x^n}} dx}
        \label{eq:1}
    \end{equation}
  math can be also referenced: \eqref{eq:1}
* include images which will be centered and can be resized: ![picture](/images/testimage.png){:height="400px"}
* highlight source codes:

~~~ python
def sum(a, b):
    return a+b
~~~

* use github mentions @mrkwjc
* include emoji like this :smile: :+1: an this :rage: :-1: and much [more](http://emoji.codes/)
* allow commenting things
